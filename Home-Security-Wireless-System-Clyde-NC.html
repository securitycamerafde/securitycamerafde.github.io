<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smart device signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
