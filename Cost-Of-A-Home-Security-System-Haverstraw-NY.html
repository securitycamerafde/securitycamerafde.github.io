We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
