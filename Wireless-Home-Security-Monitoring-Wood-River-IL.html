As infrastructure, sensors and wiring need to be placed inside the walls, which includes drilling and connecting sensors to low-voltage wires, so there's contractor labor to consider. Uninstalling, moving and re-installing a system is especially troublesome and typically inadvisable, since it suggests putting old hardware in a new place.</p>

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security since it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
