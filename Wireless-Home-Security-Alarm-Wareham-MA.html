<p>Bear in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But considering that most retail theft would not trip an alarm anyhow (an employee slipping some additional money while providing a consumer change, for example), we believe it's more crucial to have premium images so you have the proof you require. Which's what Nest offers you.</p>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems sometimes cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Spending for the equipment up front supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and start service as sometimes as you desire.</p>
