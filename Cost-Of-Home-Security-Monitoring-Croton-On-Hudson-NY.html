Alarm companies should provide property owners with instructions that supply appropriate details to operate and maintain the alarm system.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a neighborhood feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
