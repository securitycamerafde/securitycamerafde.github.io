<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is needed for transmitting video footage from the CCTV security cameras. This is one of the drawbacks of analog CCTV video surveillance, as the cable television can be difficult and costly to install, especially for larger camera networks, and those were cameras should be placed in challenging areas. The company sends an authorized professional with an average of 11 years experience to assess the home and install the equipment when customers acquire one of ADT's security packages. In some cases, the company is able to supply expert installation services the exact same day.</p>
<p>The downside? It's extremely easy to devote security mistakes that will leave your home susceptible. The moment you drive out of signal range or turn your phone to aircraft mode is the moment you have actually left your house open. This open hole in your security can prove to be a huge problem if you aren't careful. With a monitored system, that wouldn't be a concern. Nevertheless, with an unmonitored system, it depends on you to get in touch with the cops or other emergency situation services if your home is in risk. Still, the unmonitored system is much less expensive and for that reason is still the much better choice for numerous who are just concerned about cost. </p>
