<p>A self-monitored security system is typically developed to be simple so you can install it yourself without problem.

To recover costs and hold alarm companies accountable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or incorrect alarm charges, and offer physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to require cops action.</p>
