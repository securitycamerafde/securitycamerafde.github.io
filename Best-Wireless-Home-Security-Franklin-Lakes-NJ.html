A few minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it just wouldn't link. An aid window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint representative helped her troubleshoot the connection.

<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, since it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds pricey, however it's not so much when you think about that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras spot suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Guard's facility can caution a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>

<p>Home automation is simple and convenient, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automatic home gadgets are by their very nature wireless, and the majority of home security companies offer a home automation plan with an app to from another location manage everything on the system.
