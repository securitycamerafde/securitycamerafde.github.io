That individual at Deep Sentinel's center can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they refuse to engage or leave in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, however it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
