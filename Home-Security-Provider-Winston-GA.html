<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
