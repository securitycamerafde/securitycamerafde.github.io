<p>For these different systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a detailed understanding of all the required systems is required. If there are no as-built files supplying performance and setup information to make this integration work, there are just two choices.

The other technique is to replace and rip, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
