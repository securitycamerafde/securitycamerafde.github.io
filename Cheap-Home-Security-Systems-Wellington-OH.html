We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
