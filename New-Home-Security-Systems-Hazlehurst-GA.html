Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
