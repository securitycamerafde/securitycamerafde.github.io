<h2>CCTV Camera Security System For Enhanced Surveillance Saint Louis</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
<p>These cameras can pick up coloured images in extremely low-light conditions. Dark fighter technology can be used in the day and night and offer optimum performance thanks to its wide range of abilities.

Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some tricky repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
