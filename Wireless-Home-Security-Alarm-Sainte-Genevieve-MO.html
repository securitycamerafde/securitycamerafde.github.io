<p>Vivint's monitoring charges are in line with our other top security companies, which is impressive provided the advanced proprietary equipment and services that come with a Vivint home security system.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not especially innovative, so we're actually suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you opt for a three-year contract, but considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So select what will be the better offer for you. If you know you'll sit tight for a minimum of 3 years, opt for the contract and enjoy those cost savings. But if you might upgrade to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best choice.</p>

However, there were some problems with linking the command center to our tester's network. </p>
