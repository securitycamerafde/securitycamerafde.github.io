<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
