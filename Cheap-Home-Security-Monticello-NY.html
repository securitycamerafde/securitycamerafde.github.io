<p>If you do come across a home invasion emergency situation, you can trigger the 80dB alarm. I am a little disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should suffice to scare away intruders most of the times. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies responsible for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and offer physical evidence like camera video or a broken window to necessitate police response.</p>
