<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
