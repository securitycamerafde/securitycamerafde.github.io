<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful attacker, since the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and actually indirectly safeguards information by preventing it from being transferred. The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, providing a chance for the malicious assailant to tape these codes and utilize various cracking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can launch a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security key caught during the network recovery.</p>

These systems often cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Paying for the equipment in advance supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as lot of times as you want.</p>
