<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system spots a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it informs the security group and, sometimes, emergency situation responders. Regrettably, history has shown that surveillance technologies put in location for one function inevitably expand into other uses. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear borders for what CCTV systems ought to be able to do poses a substantial threat.</p>
<p>So what occurs if something activates your alarm however you remain in a conference with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed getaway and your spotty cell service implies you don't get signaled until the next day? If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the noise might frighten prospective trespassers-- if you're fortunate. However the police will not come up until you personally call them. </p>
