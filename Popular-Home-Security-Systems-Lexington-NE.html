Displays can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>Smart device integration: If you have a home full of clever gadgets, think about trying to find a security camera or an all-in-one home monitor that consists of a Z-Wave, ZigBee, or-- ultimately a Thread-- radio that can connect them.

Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
