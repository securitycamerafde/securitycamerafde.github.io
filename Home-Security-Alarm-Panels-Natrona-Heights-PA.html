<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously outstanding piece of innovation. For starters, it looks beautiful: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you envision a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you may call to mind.

This meant every windows and door needed its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
<h3>Home Security And Monitoring in Pennsylvania</h3>

There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensing units and key fobs, too.</p>
